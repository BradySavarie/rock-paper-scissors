# rock-paper-scissors

This project is pretty self-explanatory. I am building a rock, paper, scissors program to test my problem solving abilities and get my feet wet with javascript. It will be written to function as a command line interface, but in the future I plan on revisiting it to add html and css so I can allow users to interact with the game. I recognize this project is extremely common and relatively simple but it's good practice nonetheless.
