# rock-paper-scissors

I've decided to build a rock, paper, scissors application to test my problem solving abilities and get my feet wet with javascript. This application is part of The Odin Project's curriculum and will be my first project that uses html, css, and javascript. It will initially be written to function as a command line interface, however I will revisit it to add a user interface once I reach the section in The Odin Project that requires it. I recognize this project is extremely common and considered relatively simple but I expect to learn alot about programming throughout the process of creating it.
