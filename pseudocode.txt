Pseudocode

declare variables playerSelection and computerSelection of type string that are initialized as undefined
declare variables winCount and loseCount of type number that are initialized as 0
declare array choices that contains all valid strings (rock, paper, & scissors)
create getComputerSelection function that takes choices array as its input parameter and outputs a random string from within the array
initialize for loop starting at 0 that checks if winCount and loseCount are not equal to 3 and increments sentry if true
invoke getComputerSelection function and store return value in computerSelection variable
prompt for user to enter a string and store result in playerSelection variable
if user input is null print cancellation message and break
convert playerSelection to lowercase to make program caps insensitive
if user input is a valid response invoke playRound function
else print error message and return
create function playRound that takes parameters playerSelection and computerSelection
playRound function checks for winner against computerSelection variable, increments either the winCount or the loseCount variable, and returns
repeat loop until either winCount or loseCount === 3
if loseCount === 3 print defeat message
else if winCount === 3 print victory message
