declare variables playerSelection and computerSelection of type string that are initialized as undefined
declare variables winCount and loseCount of type number that are initialized as 0
declare array choices that contains all valid strings (rock, paper, & scissors)
create getComputerSelection function that takes choices array as its input parameter and outputs a random string from within the array
Initialize a for loop starting at 0 that checks if winCount or loseCount is less than 3 and increments sentry if true (sentry represents total number of rounds played)
invoke getComputerSelection function and store return value in computerSelection variable
prompt for user to enter a string and store result in playerSelection variable
convert playerSelection to lowercase to make program caps insensitive
if string is not "rock", "paper", or "scissors" send error message and reprompt user
create function playRound that takes parameters playerSelection and computerSelection
playRound function converts playerSelection input to lowercase, checks for winner against computerSelection variable, increments either the winCount or the loseCount variable, and exits function
repeat loop until either winCount or loseCount === 3
if winCount === 3 print victory message
else print defeat message
